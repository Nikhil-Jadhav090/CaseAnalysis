Case Analysis is a two-tier web app with a Django REST API backend and a React + Vite frontend secured by JWT.
It lets users create cases, run AI-powered legal analysis (Gemini) that persists to each case, and manage documents/comments.
An Admin Panel manages users and cases (approve/delete), shows activity logs, and exposes hooks for backup/restore.
